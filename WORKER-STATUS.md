# Current outcome — final integrated verification PASS

Source corrections c74141b3 and test-only repairs204b78b1 are ready for parent integration. Allfive repository gates pass:386files/8011root,261unit,27package plus typecheck/build. Complete43file browser suite:373passed,6existing skipped,0failed. Exact final exits/logs and frozen29file manifest: `.ai/qa/final-integrated/final-serial-complete.json` and `final-serial-manifest.json`.

Independent owned audit:193unique sourceframes,157owned/36delegated,152paired images inspected plus composite/state proofs. No known correctable mismatch remains in audited owned states. RealAPI/data limits and incompatible source variants remain explicitly qualified; this is not a claim that all193 mutually incompatible frames are simultaneously pixel matched. Final report: `.ai/qa/final-integrated/ACCEPTANCE.md`. Parent integration matches979 tested package/script and root build/test inputs exactly; no rerun required. The remaining36 shared references now map to fc’s completed independent review and final geometry/header/target evidence in shared-final-review-map.json. PR-ready summary: PR-BODY.md. Parent handles integration approval and push/CI coordination.

Earlier mock writes outside fixtures are explicitly recorded in `mock-write-scope.json`: nine exact fixture lines removed only from this worker’s real handoff; two earlier parent handoff lines reported and left unchanged. No real run-record mutation is established; final child isolation is verified. No push, PR, merge, delegation or self-approval was performed. Historical notes below are chronological findings, not current blockers.

# Integrated acceptance audit

Baseline b87b5082076d2c34290909b42f4dee0d9fc58804, identical to parent at start. npm ci and typecheck passed. Full five-gate run in progress with isolated CEZ_HOME and TMPDIR=/tmp, CEZ_AUTOMATIONS/CEZ_FOLLOWUPS removed. Initial full Vitest is showing slow integration cases (>8–10s); diagnosis pending full output. No product failure established yet.

193 unique reference IDs verified. Historical ledger explicitly rejected as final acceptance. Independent per-view pairing/current build checks in progress. No source edits. Command logs: .ai/qa/final-integrated/.

## Initial full-suite findings (2026-09-12 11:38 UTC)

Full npm test: 7985 passed /14 failed, 386 files. Ten server failures are explicit 5s test/10s hook timeouts, two route fallback assertions exceed their 4s wait under load (need bounded-concurrency confirmation). Two deterministic integration expectation failures:
- design-guardian.test.ts flags task-git/commit-list.tsx:132 `bg-action` on the View changes action inside a commit link (verified source; this is an action, not selection chrome). Added the explicit action-file allowance, matching existing guardian conventions; no Git source edit.
- task-quick-list.test.tsx:353 expects ungrouped +59514 −12160; shared DiffStatLabel now outputs +59,514 −12,160. Integration test expectation needs update, preserving title-floor/drop behavior.

No genuine product behavior failure established. Current fixture verified 86 asset hashes + isolated data. Remaining full gates still running. No blanket acceptance.

## BEHAVIOR FAILURE — parent action required (2026-09-12 11:41 UTC)

The two routes.test.tsx failures reproduce with maxWorkers=2 (192 pass /2 fail), so they are NOT dismissed as host load. `/p/default` remains at `scope-resolving` when registry fails; default-path fallback is broken. Suspected mechanism: newly mounted TasksOverviewRoute now calls useProjects at tasks-overview.tsx:1144; TanStack default retryOnMount refetches the errored registry, returning ProjectScopeRoute to ScopeResolving and unmounting/remounting the child. Existing route guards pin this exact load-bearing offline behavior. Investigating with isolated reproduction. Please steer source fix ownership (Tasks owner445); this worker owns integration/regression tests, not Tasks source.

Deterministic test-only fixes now pass: guardian15 and task-quick-list50. Corrected guardian finding: yellow surface is the View changes link action, not a selected row. Full-suite final retry waits for actual fallback fix.

## BEHAVIOR FAILURE — Automation editor overflow

Fresh current-built fixture confirms horizontal document overflow on all four Automation editor refs UFERI/Jn0Bt/YVkaw/Itxee. At viewport402, document.scrollWidth438; offender is `<legend class="sr-only">Review and enable</legend>` (right438). This is hidden accessibility text creating real horizontal scroll, not a long dynamic API value. Evidence automation-overflow.json and browser/Jn0Bt.png. Source owner445 should contain the positioned legend while preserving its accessible fieldset label. No Settings/shared CSS edits here.

Current milestone: 146 baseline route captures,52seeded current Settings pairs,8optional empty/disabled states,4variant waiting/error states,4plan reviews,4confirmation dialogs (cancel only),6populated global-task frames,task menus and GitHub detail/activity states. Settings MCP Reset/Save/restore and mobile scoped navigation browser checks pass. State scripts were corrected for changed copy; abandoned/loading shots explicitly not accepted. Full193ledger being annotated perview; no wholeproduct signoff.

Normal npm run test:e2e skipped (doctor cannot launch sandbox and probes unavailable CDN). Real installed Chrome successfully opens current test server through explicit --args --no-sandbox wrapper; full suite is running via npm test -- --config packages/web/e2e/vitest.config.ts. Early stale sidebar232px expectations recorded, not silently skipped. All source test repairs remain limited to guardian and grouped diff number expectation so far.

## VISUAL FAILURE — Settings Agents switch thumbs

Independent S02 desktop/mobile light+dark pairs visibly have purple tracks with no thumb. Root cause in settings-interiors.css:96 `.settings-panel .settings-toggle-field label span { display: none; }` also matches Radix's nested switch-thumb span. Must narrow to direct label text span or explicitly preserve thumb. Source owner579 only; no Settings edit here. This is not an API/data difference. Current screenshots pairs/JWelK.jpg and pairs/U6TLR.jpg show it.

## Combined check milestone — 2026-09-12 11:59 UTC

Authorized source fixes implemented: offline Tasks query disables retryOnMount only for the child query; Automation editor contains its sr-only legend in a positioned fieldset. Existing offline regression proves red before/green after;215focused tests pass. Actual browser proves populated offline Tasks and editor402px/scrollWidth402 (before438). Applied parent39c63796 as local0ebe97d1. Stable five-gate sequence running before bounded source commit.

Full direct browser suite completed:43files,266pass107fail6skip. Complete traces e2e-failures.log. This is NOT browser acceptance. Stale expectations include232px sidebar, oldbrand casing, nav first-match, Notes renamed Notes/handoff, YOU transcript label, removed decorative twinkle and status-dot, old rail/dashed selection design. Potential actual behavior/accessibility failures requiring owner diagnosis: subagent drill-down never opens, mobile Open menu measured20px under compact/dark, new-task offscreen target, Workflow target26px, mobile GitHub heading/overflow, mobile diff toggles visibility. All remain visible; no blanket stale-test dismissal. Parent/shared reviewer should investigate shared targets; no unauthorized CSS fix here.

Final source e730bd7f passes all five repository gates (full npm test 295s, unit, build, package). Browser touch file still 18 failures/6pass: obsolete Expand composer and workflow dropdown selectors, plus ultra mobile menu/starter overlap requires classification. Sidebar Active/Archived filter appears unreachable: app-shell-container.tsx134 explicitly showViewControls=false; ProjectGroups reads view but has no setter/control. This may be a removed capability and belongs to shared reviewer; preserving independence test until parent resolves.

## 2026-09-12T12:51Z correction and remaining touch regression
Sidebar filter exists in Tools (AppShellContainer152 / ToolsMenu113 / integration test337), so no missing-capability fix is needed. Actual switching test updates underway. Final touch v3:20pass4fail. View YAML summary has38.5px compact/33px ultra mobile height, below44px (wb-yaml-toggle); screenshot-source hit-area changes otherwise pass actual5point checks. Previous menu overlap was scroll-position contamination and disappears after resetting main scroll to initial layout. NewTask dark thumb mismatch remains separately reported.
