 * The typed HTTP client for a cezar service.
 *
 * `hc` reuses the SERVER's own route types, so the contract is the code: a wrong path, a wrong
 * request body or a misread response shape is a compile error, and nothing has to be mirrored
 * by hand. The app type comes from the service package
 * (`import type { AppType } from '@wjarka/cezarion/app-type'`) and is supplied by the
 * caller rather than imported here on purpose — this package must stay installable, and
 * usable at runtime, without the server package present:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import type { AppType } from '@wjarka/cezarion/app-type'
 * const cez = createCezarClient<AppType>({ baseUrl: 'http://127.0.0.1:4321' })
 * const res = await cez.api.v1['agent-config'].$get()
 * ```
 *
 * Only the versioned surface (`/api/v1/*`) is typed. The legacy `/api/*` paths stay frozen for
 * the bookmarklets and scripts that already call them (BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md §2) and are
 * deliberately not part of what a new consumer is invited to build on.

 * wire, but a caller that treats a non-2xx as a thrown error (as cezar's client does) only ever
 * holds the success shape, and forcing it to narrow a union it can never see would be noise.
 *
 * Selecting the success branch is what makes an inferred type a drop-in replacement for the
 * hand-written DTO it retires.
 *
 * EVERY 2xx, not just 200: a handler answering `c.json(x, 201)` — `POST /runs`, `/workflows`,
 * `/runs/:id/pr`, `/todos/:id/start` — has no 200 branch at all, so keying on 200 inferred
 * `never`. That stayed invisible while a hand-written DTO still annotated the call site (`never`
 * is assignable to anything) and would have surfaced as a broken caller at the exact moment
 * those DTOs were deleted.

 * A route can answer more than one format on one path — `/repo/commit/:sha` serves a structured

 * `'json'` and `'text'`/`'body'` members and `Ok` correctly picks the JSON one. But for a route
 * that is text-only, `Ok` is `never`, and `never` is assignable to EVERY declared return type: a
 * caller would compile and then fail at runtime, with the type system having said nothing.
 *
 * Substituting a branded object makes that case a readable compile error instead. It is why
