/**
 * The `cezarion` alias must import this package through a specifier its `exports` map
 * actually exposes.
 *
 * 0.9.3 shipped an alias whose `bin.js` did `import('@open-mercato/cezar/dist/index.js')`
 * while this manifest exported only `.`, `./app-type` and `./package.json`. Once a package
 * declares `exports`, Node serves ONLY the listed subpaths and hard-blocks the rest — so
 * every `npx cezarion` died with ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED against a file that was
 * sitting right there in the tarball (#851).
 *
 * Nothing else in the gate could see it. The manifest's own `bin` entries name the same
 * path and work fine, because bin paths resolve inside the package and never pass through
 * the exports gate; `check:pack` counts packed files rather than resolving them; and the
 * release e2e drives a synthetic fixture whose `bin.js` is a bare shebang. The break was
 * only reachable by resolving the real specifier against the real manifest from OUTSIDE
 * the package — which is what this does.
 *
 * Resolution is all it takes: Node applies the exports gate while resolving, before it
 * ever touches the target file, so this needs the manifest only and runs green on a fresh
 * checkout with no `dist/`.
