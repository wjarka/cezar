/** Stable-release decisions — the pure half of `scripts/release.mjs`.
 *
 *  Sibling of `snapshot.ts`, but for the *owner-driven* `latest` channel. The
 *  `Release` workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) is run manually and
 *  never fires from a push, so — unlike snapshots — a stable release is the only
 *  thing that ever moves the `latest` dist-tag (spec
 *  `.ai/specs/2026-07-18-npm-preview-publish.md`, #482).
 *
 *  Two decisions live here so they stay unit-testable and side-effect-free: the next stable
 *  version for a given bump, and the pin style the release set is stamped with. Crucially,
 *  stable releases use a **caret** range — the opposite of the snapshot stamper's exact pin —
 *  so a stable `cezarion` picks up compatible patch releases of the implementation package.
