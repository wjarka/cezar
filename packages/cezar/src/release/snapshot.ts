/** Snapshot release decisions — the pure half of `scripts/release-snapshot.mjs`.
 *
 *  Spec `.ai/specs/2026-07-18-npm-preview-publish.md` (#482): every green CI run
 *  publishes an installable preview of the CLI. This module decides *whether* a
 *  given CI event publishes, under *which* version and dist-tag, and how the two
 *  manifests (the scoped package and its unscoped alias) are stamped. Kept
 *  dependency-free and side-effect-free so the decision is unit-testable; the
 *  script owns file writes, `npm publish`, and the exit code.
 *
 *  Deliberately name-agnostic: package names come from the checked-out manifests
 *  at call time, never from constants — so the `@pat-lewczuk/cezar` →
 *  `@wjarka/cezarion` rename (#23) lands independently of this pipeline.
