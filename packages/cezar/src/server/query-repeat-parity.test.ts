/**
 * Moving the query string onto `queryZodValidator` changed one thing on the wire that nothing
 * else notices: Hono hands a REPEATED key to the validator as an array (`?wait=1&wait=1` →
 * `['1','1']`), where the `c.req.query('k')` these routes used before silently took the first
 * value. A plain `z.string()` therefore turns a request that answered 200 into a 400.
 *
 * `queryValue` in server.ts collapses the array back to its first element. One strict route and
 * one permissive route are enough to pin it — every query schema shares that helper. `/skills`
 * would exercise it too but shells out to discover skills, so it times out under a loaded full
 * run; a guard that flakes teaches people to ignore it. Same for `/providers/status` — inject a
 * no-spawn auth service so the parity check never waits on real CLIs.
