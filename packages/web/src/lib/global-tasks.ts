/**
 * The pure half of the global Tasks page (`/tasks`): joining the cross-project run index to the
 * project registry, filtering it, and grouping it. The route only paints what these say.
 *
 * Pure on the same terms as `lib/task-groups.ts` and `lib/tasks-table.ts` — no React, no router,
 * no clock — because this is the behavior worth testing as a table.
 *
 * Three decisions worth stating once, here, rather than re-deriving them in the component:
 *
 * 1. **A task's tags are its PROJECT's tags.** Tags label repositories, not runs (see
 *    `ProjectListEntry.tags`), and the whole point of the page is that a `storefront` tag on
 *    three repos makes one list out of three projects' work. A task therefore appears under
 *    EVERY tag its project carries when grouping by tag — a run in a repo tagged
 *    `storefront` + `frontend` is genuinely both, and showing it once (under an arbitrary
 *    "first" tag) would hide it from the other group.
 * 2. **Every facet is a SET, and an empty set means "no opinion".** Values inside one facet are
 *    ORed, facets are ANDed: `tags: [storefront, infra], statuses: [running]` reads as "running
 *    work anywhere in storefront or infra". Single-select would force the exact question the
 *    page exists to answer — "how are these two repos doing?" — to be asked twice.
 *
 * 3. **Row identity is `projectId/id`.** The index already keys on the pair, and run ids are only
 *    unique within a project's `runs.json`.
