 * eleven statuses are read by the chip, by its tooltip, and by the tests that pin them, and a
 * status whose color says "fine" while its sentence says "blocked" is the exact defect a shared
 * table prevents.
 *
 * `tone` names a role, never a color — `danger` is what the token sheet paints red today. The
 * five roles are the design system's own status vocabulary (see `StatusDot`), so a status can
 * only ever look like something the cockpit already looks like.

/**
 * The OTHER axis, in the same shape: a pull request whose branch no longer merges into its base.
 *
 * It sits BESIDE the table rather than in it because it is not one of the eleven. Those answer
 * "whose move is it" and are mutually exclusive; this is a second fact that can be true alongside
 * any of them — most sharply alongside `ready`, whose whole sentence ("open, checks pass, nothing
 * is waiting on a reviewer") stays true of a pull request GitHub will not merge. That pair is what
 * this was reported for.
 *
 * It is still painted on the SAME chip — the one that links to the pull request — because a
 * reference has one chip and this is that reference's state. What it takes over is the colour, the
 * glyph and the tooltip's headline; the status it overrode keeps its own line in that tooltip, so
 * nothing is lost by showing the blocker first.
 *
 * `conflict` and not `danger`: red already says "the checks failed" and "a reviewer asked for
 * changes" on these very chips, and a third meaning on one colour is how a colour stops meaning
 * anything. Not `pending` either — nothing resolves this on its own. It is the author's move.
