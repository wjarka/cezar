/**
 * "Where is this project?" — the active project's absolute root, inside project settings.
 *
 * Settings is the one place a user goes to ask what a project IS, and the answer to the most
 * basic question ("which folder on disk?") used to live only in the GLOBAL registry table, one
 * area away and listing every project rather than this one. The path shown here is the registry's
 * `root`: absolute and realpath-normalized, the same string the server resolves worktrees and git
 * commands against, so it can be pasted straight into a terminal.
 *
 * Two renderings, both from this file so they cannot drift:
 *  - `ProjectFolderField` — the General dashboard's row: the path WRAPPED rather than truncated
 *    (seeing all of it is the point), plus the two things a user wants it for — Copy, and
 *    "Open with" (this machine's editors, file manager and terminal, via `POST /api/v1/open-in`);
 *  - `ProjectLocationNav` — the desktop section nav's footer, the project-scope twin of the
 *    global nav's "Stored in ~/.cezar": one truncated line that keeps the answer on every section.
 *
 * Both render NOTHING when the root is unknown (registry still loading, or an unscoped mount): a
 * placeholder path is worse than no path, and the registry answer arrives within a tick anyway.
