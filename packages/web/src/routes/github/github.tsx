/**
 * `/github` — the forge tab rebuilt in React (R6 Step 1.1, spec §"GitHub tab (forge tab)"):
 * functionally the legacy tab — issues/PRs lists, a detail pane with markdown body + label
 * chips + checks badge, drag-to-composer, hand-to-agent — with the chip walls replaced by
 * searchable cmdk dropdowns (#385) and every surface a URL: `/github` (issues),
 * `/github/prs`, `/github/issues/:n`, `/github/prs/:n`. PR rows also carry a compact checks
 * glyph (#400) — the same tones as the detail pane's `ChecksBadge`, just the symbol.
 *
 * Data loads in ONE fast shot (#664): the list call no longer fetches `statusCheckRollup` — the
 * CI rollup for every open PR was the dominant cost and forced the old two-shot `30 → 1000`
 * pattern — so a single `limit`-capped fetch paints the whole open set quickly and search works
 * across it immediately. Each PR row's checks glyph is then hydrated lazily, for the on-screen
 * rows only, via `useGithubChecks` (`GET /api/github/checks`), the same way comment counts fill
 * in a beat later. A cheap React-Query prefetch on row hover/focus warms the thread so an opened
 * item is usually instant. (Cursor pagination + "Load more"/infinite scroll + row virtualization
 * are the Phase 2 follow-up.)
 *
 * Gating: the nav item is hidden by the shell when health reports no forge — but the URL
 * stays reachable (pasted links), so an unavailable payload renders the honest explainer
 * with the server's own reason, never an error.
 */

/** The single fast list fetch (`/api/github` limit). No longer split into a fast batch + a slow

 *
 * A one-way check, not a live sync: it reads `ui-state.json` once per mount and either renders
 * Issues or hands off to `/github/prs`. It never redirects back to Issues from `/github/prs` —
 * that URL is authoritative on its own.
 *
 * It is an `index` FLAG on this component rather than a wrapper component of its own, and that
