/**
 * The cockpit's client for its own HTTP API.
 *
 * Same-origin by construction: the Hono server serves this bundle and owns `/api/v1/*`, and the
 * Vite dev server proxies `/api` to it. So every URL here is root-relative — there is no base
 * URL to configure and no cross-origin case to get wrong.
 *
 * Calls name a ROUTE (`/runs/:id/diff`), never a URL: `apiPath` (api-client) adds the version
 * and, when a project scope is active, the `/p/<id>` segment. That is why the version appears
 * once in this repo rather than at every call site. `runFileRawUrl` is the one URL this module
 * hands out instead of fetching itself, so it resolves the route at build time.
 *
 * This module is the boundary. It parses responses, turns every non-2xx into an `ApiError`
 * carrying the server's own words, and does nothing else: no caching, no retries, no
 * reconnect. Freshness is SSE's job and TanStack Query's (queries.ts, and Step 3.2's reconcile).
 *
 * Every call goes through the typed client (`cez`/`unwrap` below), which checks the route against
 * the server's own handlers. Three functions keep their own `fetch` for a reason `hc` cannot
 * express, and each says which in its own comment: `registerProject` (a 409 is a SUCCESS for the
 * add-project flow), `requestText` (the routes that answer `text/plain`), and `runFileRawUrl`
 * (a URL handed to an `<img>`, never fetched). All of them end in the same `ApiError` contract,
 * so a caller cannot tell which path a given function uses.
