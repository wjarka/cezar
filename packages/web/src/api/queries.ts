 * Query keys, in one place and exported, because they are a contract rather than an

 *
 * Hierarchical on purpose — `queryKeys.runs.all` invalidates the list and every single-run

 *
 * Every key leads with the ACTIVE project scope (multi-project spec, step 3.1): the registered
 * project id, or the stable `'default'` sentinel when unscoped — read at access time via
 * `queryScope()`, which is why the constant keys are getters. One cache, never bleeding across
 * projects: project A's `['a','runs','list']` and project B's `['b','runs','list']` are simply
 * different entries, and a scoped invalidation (`queryKeys.runs.all` under scope A) can only
