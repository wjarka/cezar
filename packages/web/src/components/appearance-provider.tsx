/** Owns accent, density and reading width (Settings → Appearance, R6 Step 1.3).
 *
 *  Boot order, mirroring the theme's no-flash contract:
 *   1. the pre-paint script in index.html stamps density/width deviations from the localStorage
 *      mirror before the bundle loads; the sole accent needs no DOM attribute;
 *   2. this provider seeds from the same mirror, so mounting never repaints;
 *   3. when `GET /api/workspace/ui-state` answers, the server value is authoritative — it is
 *      applied and mirrored, so the next cold load pre-paints the truth.
 *
 *  The store is the GLOBAL one (`~/.cezar/ui-state.json`) since the multi-project split
 *  (step 3.5, spec §"Settings split"): appearance describes the person at the keyboard,
 *  not a repo, and this provider sits ABOVE the router — it has no project scope to write to
 *  in the first place. Migration 001 copied the pre-existing per-repo value up, so upgrading
 *  keeps whatever the boot project had; the per-repo key is left alone and simply ignored.
 *
 *  Writes go through `PUT /api/workspace/ui-state` with the FULL `appearance` object every
 *  time: the server merges ui-state shallowly (top-level keys), so a partial `{ accent }`
 *  would drop the stored density. On a failed write the server truth is re-fetched and
 *  re-applied — the control must not claim a persistence the file never got.
