/**
 * The pin control (#935) — one button, shared by every surface that lists a task: the sidebar
 * quick-list row, the Tasks table row, the mobile card. (The thread header spells the same
 * action as a labelled button beside Archive, because a header has room for the word.)
 *
 * Shared rather than re-styled per surface for the reason the status dot is: a pin is one idea,
 * and three hand-rolled variants of it would drift into three different meanings of "filled".
 * The filled pin means pinned, the outline one means "pinnable"; the surface decides only when
 * the outline is *visible* (a row reveals it on hover so it is not permanently busy — see the
 * width-priority rule in `task-quick-list.tsx`) by passing its own classes.
 *
 * `stopPropagation` because two of the three surfaces are row-click navigation targets: the
 * click belongs to the pin, not to "open the task".
