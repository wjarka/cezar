 * value carries its run id so a pasted id finds its thread, and a run id is a uuid. Typing a task
 * number like `767` then subsequence-matches the stray `7`, `6`, `7` scattered through dozens of
 * unrelated uuids, and those accidents outrank the task actually called "767: …".
 *
 * So: SUBSTRING matching, every whitespace-separated token required (`shop auth` finds the auth
 * task in shop, and nothing else). Ranking, best first:
 *
 *  - a token starting at a word boundary beats one buried mid-word — `767` in `767: fix the thing`
 *    beats `767` inside `…a767b…`, which is exactly the uuid case;
 *  - an earlier match beats a later one, gently, so a title hit outranks an id hit;
 *  - the score is the mean across tokens, so every token has to be good, not just one.
 *
 * Returns 0 to hide the row — cmdk drops anything scoring 0 and sorts the rest descending, both
 * within a group and between groups. That is what puts the best match at the top of the list
 * rather than wherever its section happens to sit.

 * BOOT project. Passing the URL's active id here instead would, on global settings, fail to match
 * the index's boot rows and list every boot task twice. The caller resolves it: active id, else

 *
 * Dedup is per RUN, not per project: an index row is dropped only when the live list already has
 * that exact task. The live row wins — it is the one the SSE stream patches, and preferring a
 * snapshot for the project you are looking at would make the palette lag the sidebar beside it.
 * Dropping the whole project instead would be smaller code and a worse failure mode: the moment
 * `runsProjectId` disagreed with what `useRuns()` actually returned, every task in that project
 * would vanish from the palette rather than merely arrive a few seconds stale.
 *
 * Ordering is locality-first, like `orderProjects`: the active project's tasks (newest first),
 * then everyone else's (newest first). An unfiltered palette therefore looks exactly as it did
 * before this became cross-project — typing is what reaches into the other projects, and cmdk
