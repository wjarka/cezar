 * device shows. Radix's hover card is built for sighted pointer users and says so in code: its
 * trigger `preventDefault()`s `touchstart` — which on a chip that IS a link means a tap stops
 * opening the pull request — and its content re-writes `tabindex="-1"` onto every focusable thing
 * inside it on each render, which made the "Resolve conflicts" button unreachable by keyboard.
 * Neither is a bug to work around; it is the primitive stating what it is for.
 *
 * A popover ANCHOR attaches no handlers at all, so the chip keeps every native behaviour it had
 * before this feature existed — tap, click, middle-click, Enter — and popover content leaves
 * focus alone, so a button in it is a button. The hover behaviour is then ours: open on a rested
 * pointer or on focus, close when both the chip and the panel are left.
 *
 * Focus is never STOLEN (`onOpenAutoFocus` is prevented): a panel that opens because the pointer
 * paused must not move the caret. Instead, when there is something in it to press, Tab from the
 * chip goes into it — the DOM order a portal took away, put back by hand — and Escape comes back
 * out. A panel with only words does not intercept Tab, so the other several hundred chips in the
 * cockpit keep exactly the tab order they have always had.
 *
 * On a TOUCH device the panel does not open at all, and that is the trade rather than an
 * oversight: a tap on a chip belongs to the link it is, and there is no second gesture to spend
 * without taking that back. Everything the panel says is also on the chip — its colour, its glyph
 * and its accessible name — and the action it holds is reachable from the task's own composer.
