 * provider/config queries new-task.tsx reads. The composer itself keeps its own inline copy —
 * it threads the pills through a persisted draft and a variants pill this pair has no notion of.
 *
 * The caller owns the pick (`null` = never touched, so the configured default shows through);
 * this component only resolves and renders. `useResolvedEngine` hands back what the POST body
 * needs, so the pick and the thing sent to the server can never disagree.

 *
 * That second rule is deliberately NOT the composer's `runnerCount > 1 ? runner : undefined`.
 * Counting backends answers "is there a choice to make", which is the right question for
 * *rendering the pill* and the wrong one for *omitting the field*: the two diverge exactly
 * when the configured `defaultRunner` is disconnected. Then `resolveRunner` falls back to a
 * connected backend and the model pill lists ITS presets — but the count is 1, so no runner is
 * sent, and the server resolves the omitted field back to the disconnected default. Comparing
 * against the active project's authoritative config default preserves omission when it is safe
 * and explicitly sends the provider-status fallback when it is not. A sticky/user pick always
 * rides the request, so a boot-project snapshot can never erase that intent.
