# Skills and Workflows — integrated verification

The scoped implementation and integrated verification are ready for parent review. Both shared dependencies are integrated: adapter parent `463821c6` as `9d2040fd`, shell parent `15ef08fc` as `e05520da`. No dependency wait remains. The residual differences below remain visible; this report does not claim all frames are pixel-identical.

Additional real-API verification is recorded in `real-runtime/README.md`: ten supplementary browser captures and a persisted workflow import/reorder/save/conflict/overwrite/reload/delete round trip, using the parent's reusable isolated fixture. That supplement verifies the earlier `c6d56857` build's 93 assets; its recorded hashes are intentionally historical after the subsequent glyph/layout pass. These content-different captures supplement the original 74 matched-fixture entries and do not establish additional exact visual matches.

## Source and ownership

- Confirmed source: parent `cezarion.pen`, commit `ac3f4a89`.
- SHA256: `56a71a27c7795137cab1c0a40a5839edecbacab4014d2d39ddc90f89343275f8`; 8,498,974 bytes; 193 frames. Verified before implementation and again after it; never edited.
- `reference/` contains original PNG exports for the 26 related frames and their original export metadata. These are from iteration 3, not the rejected iteration-2 design.
- Owned code: Skills route, skill detail/import components, Workflows route, scoped CSS, and two stale copy assertions in the Skills tests. No API, engine, Settings/bookmarklet-inner, shell, shared primitive, global-style, or asset modifications.
- Current source icons are `type: icon`, `library: lucide`, with names such as `search`, `square-check`, `file-code`, and `wand-sparkles`. Rescanned the current JSON instead of using the rejected font-path map. Owned surfaces now import the parent's exact filled-glyph adapter, integrated from `463821c6` as `9d2040fd`; no duplicate adapter was created. The `circle-check` design export supplies the existing success-state icon alias.
- Parent coordination attempts for the shared adapter were rejected with `Conversation capacity limit reached` (request `27428325-966e-4607-8490-5a1fb7e5ee3e`, progress `4678566f-29af-4531-a86a-50514a320852`). The adapter was subsequently discovered in the parent checkout and integrated directly; the shared shell was subsequently integrated from `15ef08fc` and the entire matrix rebuilt.

`current-export-proof.json` verifies all 26 stored PNGs against the completed 193-frame export. The hashes are unchanged. It also records the shared-adapter integration and Poppins metric comparison.

## What changed

The catalog uses the 310px desktop column, responsive 25px/30px headings, search glyphs, the selected tool treatment, and the source's row spacing. The shared reader uses the source badge and a 16px Markdown content rhythm. Manage skills uses the confirmed copy, outline checkbox glyphs over native inputs, flat installation card, and separate mobile filter/action rows.

Workflows uses the 300px palette, left selector chevron, appropriately sized toolbar/palette glyphs, compact desktop step headings, explicit mobile reorder controls, and the confirmed Auto copy. Import is an accessible Radix dialog with its mobile surface below the header. Add-step and destructive confirmations use the source's typography and action labels. Parser errors preserve the user's YAML. Highlighting the first catalog row while Manage is open does not falsely mark that row as the current page.

The browser caught a mobile Import regression during implementation: the compiled shared centering utilities retained `translate: -50% -50%` despite a `transform: none` override, producing `x=-201, y=-110.5` at a 402px viewport. Responsive translate utilities now reset both underlying Tailwind variables. Browser clicks on Import and Cancel succeed without force; captured bounds start at `x=0, y=52`. The drag append indicator also retains a full-width positioned canvas anchor.

## Evidence and reproduction

`pairs.json` is the per-capture ledger: reference ID and PNG hash, actual PNG, URL, viewport, theme, comfortable density, fixture file, confirmed design hash, and exact built index hash. `build-proof.json` records the built index and JS/CSS asset hashes. `browser-capture.log` contains the actual dialog/card bounds. `server-start-proof.json` identifies the locally built service and isolated CEZ_HOME; its index hash is the server's *initial* build, superseded for visual captures by `build-proof.json` and the per-pair hashes.

There are 74 browser captures: 22 full route/frame pairs, 4 selector-control captures, 32 workflow interaction captures, and 16 supplementary managed-skill/error captures. Full-size route pairs are in `comparisons/`; overview sheets are navigation aids rather than pixel-diff verdicts. Original PNGs and actual screenshots remain separate and unchanged.

For fit-content mobile frames, the export manifest's estimated height differs from the actual PNG height. Final route viewport heights use `pngHeight / scaleX`, preserving the PNG's aspect ratio. `pair-images.py` performs only uniform scaling for side-by-side display. Supplementary states without a dedicated frame point to their enclosing design surface; those are not claims that the whole screenshot matches a static base frame. Editing frame 32 is a component sheet, so actual dialog `*-content.png` crops correspond to individual cards in that sheet.

The runtime starts this worktree's built service and serves this worktree's built Vite assets. The fixture follows the earlier verified runtime recipe with its own local repo and CEZ_HOME. Team repositories are explicitly disabled in the portable launcher. Browser fixtures supply populated skills/workflows, managed-skill update states, and parser/overwrite errors. All exercised mutations are intercepted browser responses; no actual installs, updates, PRs, or agent runs are launched. The bookmarklet key is a fixed fixture string, not a credential.

Reproduce from the worktree root after installing locked dependencies:

```sh
npm run build:server
npm run build:web
node .ai/design-reference/iteration-3/skills-workflows/serve-fixture.mjs "$PWD" 44633
```

In another terminal, provide an installed Playwright module, Chromium executable, and the confirmed design export directory:

```sh
env -u TMP -u TEMP TMPDIR=/tmp \
  CEZ_QA_PLAYWRIGHT=/absolute/path/to/playwright/index.mjs \
  CEZ_QA_CHROMIUM=/absolute/path/to/chrome \
  CEZ_QA_DESIGN=/absolute/path/to/iteration-3/design \
  node .ai/design-reference/iteration-3/skills-workflows/capture.mjs
python3 .ai/design-reference/iteration-3/skills-workflows/pair-images.py
```

The pairing helper needs Pillow. These `CEZ_QA_*` values are fixture-script inputs, not service configuration or new product environment variables.

## Review findings by surface

| Surface and references | Evidence | Actual remaining differences / limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Skills desktop `EKi57`, `cvBro` | Same-name PNGs and comparisons | Confirmed 264px shell now puts the catalog at x=300. Route and shell glyphs use the exact exported paths. Fixture project/Pinned/Recent content differs from the source samples. Small text/border-rendering and row-height differences remain. |
| Skills mobile `kmHeY`, `XdHUd` | Same-name pairs | Correct catalog-only structure, tools, search/refresh, and seven populated rows. Header brand/project controls belong to shared shell. The metadata line height is restored to the source’s normal 15px at 10px size, removing the earlier cumulative compression. A few pixels of border/text rendering drift remain. |
| Detail mobile `acXhB`, `utoCL` | Same-name pairs | Back routing, badge, title, source, usage and Markdown are present. Typography/list indentation and several vertical positions still differ slightly. Desktop reading width now uses the integrated 264px shell. |
| Manage `f2LGv`, `suUEJ`, `MB5Yx`, `IbcKi` | Same-name pairs | Tools, current status, search, remove-all and all three outlined enabled controls are visible. The source overlays its frame strokes, whereas CSS borders consume space. The reader inset now accounts for that pixel, descriptions use the source's 6px gap, and status/explanatory text uses 1.6 line height. The first description now stays on one line in the actual mobile capture. Font audit confirms both Poppins binaries measure the first description at 260.7px at 12px; the old 260px text column forced an extra line. Global surface/ink colors remain different. Runtime tracked-scope and last-check details remain conditional and were not removed to imitate an empty static card. |
| Workflows `C2sfEo`, `s0JzCL`, `aa0TQ`, `Ae0n6` | Same-name pairs | Metadata, toolbar, two populated steps, palette, YAML disclosure and Save are present. Command summaries deliberately show the actual command/retry target rather than replacing them with the design's prose. Shared mobile 44px target floors make step headings taller than the 26px glyph row in the mockup; disabled boundary reorder actions remain visibly disabled. |
| Auto `VDDSI`, `MmQCH`, `Zsg4w`, `e7UWy` | Same-name pairs | Prompt and Build/Cancel controls are populated. Textarea outline/ink and vertical spacing still differ. Source controls are idle; the browser textarea retains a visible interaction outline. The integrated shell is used. |
| Import/error `lRC5W`, `KwkJs`, `djknR`, `MF4eF` | `import-*`, `import-error-*`, content crops | Actual dialog opens and controls work on both viewport classes/themes. Real parser-error copy replaces the design's instructional placeholder. The desktop design is a component sheet, not an overlay specification. Mobile header uses the integrated shared shell and actual fixture project identity. |
| Add step / delete / overwrite, frame 32 | `add-step-*`, `delete-*`, `overwrite-*` | All dialogs are open with real fixture data and visible controls. Add selection keeps a visible selected state and a close affordance; destructive dialogs retain mobile stacked actions. These runtime states are not represented one-for-one by separate mobile design frames. |
| Workflow selector | `selector-*` | The native closed selector, left chevron, and selected fixture workflow are captured. Native platform popup pixels are not part of Chromium's page screenshots; there is no separate open-selector design frame in the confirmed source. Existing load-selection behavior is covered by route tests. |
| YAML, step menu, empty palette | `yaml-*`, `step-menu-*`, `filter-empty-*` | Supplementary interaction evidence. Source frames show the entry controls rather than separate expanded states. YAML remains actual generated YAML, and the step menu retains removal. |
| Managed states / errors | `manage-{current,available,updating,error,disabled,filter-empty}-*`, `skills-error-*`, `manage-error-*` | Populated mock states exercise conditional update/error/selection layout. Their reference is the enclosing Manage design; the source has no distinct frame for every server status. Supplementary screenshots are not a visual-match claim for those absent frames. |
| Bookmarklet wrapper `gqaUM`, `EsGpp`, `YS15Y`, `wLVhd` | Same-name pairs | Skills tools/list/back wrapper checked. Inner panel is owned by the Settings worker and unchanged. Fixture catalog creates seven launchers versus three examples in the design; its typography, filtering glyph, action glyphs, and mobile length still differ. |

The source badge and browser commands use shared semantic tokens. This final capture uses the integrated shell/font/glyph implementation. Every assigned frame has evidence; component-sheet and supplementary states are distinguished from full-frame pairs. No assigned subview is silently omitted.

## Behavioral verification

- `npm run typecheck:web` — pass.
- `npm run test -w @open-mercato/cezar-web -- src/routes/skills.test.tsx src/routes/workflows/workflows.test.tsx src/lib/workflow-builder.test.ts src/components/design-icons.test.tsx src/components/app-shell.test.tsx src/components/app-shell-container.test.tsx` — 192 tests pass. No stale expectations required changes and no behavioral regression was found by these suites.
- Production web build — pass.
- Browser matrix — complete; all 74 ledger entries have zero horizontal overflow. That check is supplementary to the visual inspections, not their substitute.
- Existing custom-prompt precedence, parser error preservation, import/save/overwrite, YAML export, reorder, managed-skill write ordering, refresh selection, and bookmarklet routing tests remain active. Only two static copy assertions changed to the confirmed wording.

## Inventory coverage

`inventory-coverage.json` classifies every one of the 193 confirmed frames: 22 owned Skills/Workflows frames, four Skills wrappers with Settings-owned bookmarklet interiors, four explicitly Settings-owned Skills frames, and 163 outside this assignment. All 22 owned and four wrapper frames have capture entries. It separately lists selector, import/error, add-step, delete/overwrite, YAML, step-menu, empty-palette, and managed-state/error evidence. Reproduce using `inventory-coverage.py <complete-design-directory>`.

## Parent review

Parent can integrate the scoped commits independently. Parent already has the adapter and shell originals; do not duplicate `9d2040fd` or `e05520da`. Scoped state coverage and integrated rebuilt captures are complete. Bookmarklet-inner differences remain with the Settings owner. No human approval gate or adapter/shell wait is requested. Coordination is recorded in root `WORKER-STATUS.md` because family messages are exhausted.
